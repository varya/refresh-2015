# Plan

1. Introduction
   - first slide
   - about me
   - component-based development
1. The development workflow
1. Styleguides
   - Examples of styleguide
     - GitHub
   - challenges:
     - easy to start
     - keep the documentation up-to date
     - keep the markup for the component up-to-date<br/>
       This is why we have Angular directives feature
     - fast start (this is why CSS-based)
     - edit on fly
     - bridge the gap between designers and developers
1. The needed features of SC5 StyleGuide Generator
   - CSS encapsulation
   - parse the variables
     - see what's affected by changing a variable
     - see the variables used
1. In use

"I liked the idea of having to think about a design in pieces, and then also think about it as a whole."

"I found very helpful during this project to have your ideal CSS architecture and organization documented before you
do any refactoring."

"Keeping Style Guides Current and Useful"

"A common question I’ve received at conferences is, “How do you find time to work on a style guide?” — which is a very
valid question."

"I think the more automated you get and the more integrated into your workflow the style guide becomes, the more useful
it will be — and it can actually be quite fun."

"even with the clear benefits, taking the necessary steps to create and start using them is easier said than done, as
quite often the challenge is cultural, requiring changes in people’s mindsets"

"make the transition as painless as possible"

"design lacks consitency"

"old-school process is prone to error"

“Process changes are much more profound than the technology that enables them.”
– John Albin Wilkins

"Being able to see each component in every possible state helps to ensure that everything is visually correct and that
all the necessary states are present."

"Having each component displayed separately suits the idea of modular development perfectly and encourages the creation
of independent building blocks for the interface."

Refactoring: "any change affecting the components and their states can be easily checked visually, decreasing the chance
of something breaking accidentally"
